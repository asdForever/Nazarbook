When the ship is sinking, the crew should not look for someone to blame; they should take action, standing side by side.<>

Without a purpose cannot exist neither man nor the power structure, nor society.<>

Our young people should not live in a fool’s paradise. There is no paradise outside Kazakhstan. There is no land or country where you can get everything all at once.<>

Our young people need to be brought up to be loyal to their Motherland and to be ready to defend it the same way our grandparents and great-grandparents did.<>

Young people are the foundation of our future.<>

You need to get a quality education. It will be your bastion in life.<>

Our youth should study, acquire new knowledge, master new skills, and be able to efficiently and skillfully deploy new technologies and expertise in their daily lives.<>

People who have no clear goals, who do not dream of something sublime, will pursue only small, narrow-minded interests and seek temporary material gain. This leads to the degradation of society.<>

Being the master of your own destiny is more valuable than the possession of all the wealth in the world.<>

Recognition is the best compliment.<>

The competitiveness of the individual is the combination of life experiences, which allows being ready for a dynamically changing present and for an unknown future.<>

A competitive individual, who was born in a unique environment, should, first and foremost, know his own language and culture.<>

People tend to live looking at their past, present and the future. But the present quickly turns into past. Therefore, we should live our lives looking primarily towards the future.<>

People should start learning not only from the mistakes of others, but also from their achievements.<>

A Government cannot change the minds of the people all at once.<>

At the present stage of development of mankind the human factor is decisive.<>

During the learning process people not only acquire new knowledge, but also look for opportunities to apply it.<>

The education of children is a huge investment for the future.<>

Preparing children for knowledge and hard work is a parent’s duty.<>

A healthy nation is the basis for our successful future.<>

School gives us our first lessons in life. School teaches us how to live and behave within society and how to obey its rules. However, education should not overwhelm the individual qualities of the child.<>

The main principle in the developed world today is that people follow jobs, jobs do not follow people.<>

All people try to get to a place where there is an opportunity to earn and build their lives. This is an axiom for all the developed countries in the world.<>

If we plan to achieve a high world standard of living, we need to work hard.<>

Religious fanaticism, as a rule, does not come from excessive religiosity, but from a lack of real religious culture.<>

It is time to start considering religion as something that unites people together, not opposes them against each other.<>

The transformation of religion into an instrument of preaching violence and persecution has not been caused by the God within us, but by politicos.<>

If parents take care of their children, children take care of their elderly parents, and women have honor and respect in the family and in society, it will be unnecessary to worry about the fate of the nation.<>

For centuries, the Kazakh language has been the core element in the preservation of the nation’s cultural integrity, due to its uniqueness.<>

History and language have the same roots.<>

The key element in strengthening the nation is the language.<>

I rely on you, new generation of Kazakhstan. You should be the driving force of the new policy.<>

Tradition and culture are the genetic code of the nation.<>

Only a healthy nation can be competitive.<>

The nation’s most valuable resources, its wealth and treasures, are not in the ground and not on the surface – they’re in the hearts of our people.<>

The deviation of the culture of speech leads to a change in the way we think.<>

The Mother tongue is the Mother of all of us, because it is the Mother of our Nation.<>

For us, there is no historical heritage more valuable than our native language. Therefore, there is no greater duty for us than to value and preserve it.<>

If Kazakhs living abroad can thoroughly master the language of their country of residence – that is good. If they can speak well in foreign languages – that is even better. But if they can speak a dozen foreign languages but strangle and bury their own native language – that is an unpardonable sin.<>

The public figure who truly cares for the people will point the way up to the top, not down into the pit.<>

As long as the individual has no freedom, society will not be free. As long as there is no free society, there will be no room for freedom of thought. If there is no freedom of thought – there will be no success in action.<>

People need to accustom themselves to thinking: “If I break the Law today, who will stand up and protect me in case someone will violate my rights and freedoms the next day?”<>

Human beings do not live forever, but their good deeds do.<>

A person’s every deed – both good and bad – will get a fair evaluation from their descendants.<>

I prefer humble but worthy deeds that make sense, rather than empty but beautiful promises.<>

In any society, people are respected for their work.<>

A woman is not only a life giver, she herself is life.<>

All kindness, good manners and compassion come with mother’s milk.<>

A woman is in charge of the cradle. Hence, if women's status and condition do not improve, the cradle will be empty. And if our cradles are empty, the nation’s population will not grow.<>

It is impossible to imagine a normally functioning society without women – tender in everyday life, sublime in their emotions, persistent in business and career.<>

No one gains honor by abusing their ancestors. But it is also foolish to blindly cling to the past, not gaining from useful experience, having no regrets, just forgetting the bad.<>

It is not a rich facade and a nice interior that brings happiness into a new house – it is order, mutual respect and harmony in the family.<>

If people haven't dreamed of great accomplishments in their youth, it's a waste of time to expect outstanding results from them in their maturity.<>

If modesty adorns people, then it even more so adorns our talented young people.<>

Our young people must live and act so as to treasure our customs and traditions, to excite and inspire others with their talent, and to freely navigate into the advanced spaces of mankind’s knowledge.<>

Talent is not only a gift from God. It is also a high responsibility to yourself, to society and to the Homeland.<>

For a true politician, it is necessary to have a combination of at least three qualities: theoretical training, practical work experience in the economy, and responsibility for one’s decisions.<>

Children are the most vulnerable and unprotected members of our society, and they should not be deprived of their rights. As the Leader of the Nation I demand the protection of the rights of every child.<>

Any child born on our land is a Kazakhstan citizen, and the State must care for them.<>

Remember: your personal success is the success of your parents, the success of your relatives, the success of your families, the success of all your fellow citizens and, most of all, the success of our Homeland.<>

The State does its best to open new opportunities for you. These are opportunities that your parents couldn't even dream about.<>
