I wish you to love and care for your Motherland<>

True patriotism is not in fiery speeches; it is in concrete work and responsible actions.<>

For us, to be a patriot is our filial duty, our honor, and our tribute to the ancestors who sacrificed their lives for the Motherland.<>

The most valuable quality of the Kazakh consciousness is the ability to sensitively understand the worldviews and values of others.<>

For us, the descendants of great ancestors, it is a disgrace to settle for someone else’s leftovers. It is time for us to adopt the newest methods and technologies and work for the future with no regrets.<>

Kazakh literature, language, folklore and music all enrich the spiritual potential in each of us.<>

The friendship of nations is not just our great and unique common achievement, it is also our faith and hope.<>

Nations are like living organisms – their development is limited by their socio-biological and cultural capabilities.<>

The path to global development lies not through isolation and disconnection, but through the process of integration and unification.<>

Kazakh culture and the culture of our Turkic ancestors have always been syncretic; the affects on it were not limited to one single influence.<>

The ethnic and cultural diversity of Kazakhstan is not a trap for us; it is our advantage and our potential to develop and prosper.<>

The cultural space of Kazakhstan is a space of cohe-rence and complementarity between its various ethnic cultures.<>

We have only one Homeland and it is an Independent Kazakhstan.<>

We need a patriotic spirit as we need air.<>

There is no bigger mission for me than developing and introducing my country into the category of developed countries of the world.<>

If the nation does not prosper, the individual will not prosper.<>

There are a lot of places in the world where one can work and earn a living, or even achieve a high position within society. But what does it all mean in comparison to a sip of water from your Homeland?<>

When your nation is looking to you with such hopes and anticipation, how can you remain placid?<>

It does not matter whether you are a sultan or a shepherd; if you are not in your home country, you are an orphan.<>

If the country is united it will have one heart and common aspirations.<>

The maturity of society, as well as the courage of a citizen, is known in the hour of trial.<>

Children of a prosperous country are full of dreams; children of a declining nation are sowers of discord.<>

A country riven by disputes will always have enemies.<>

To make a country a successful nation it must have spirit, dignity and faith.<>

Unless every person living in Kazakhstan recognizes himself as the nation’s child and is imbued with faith in the country’s future, we will not progress.<>

In my opinion, there is no greater saying than this one: “Life is above everything, but my honor is above my life”. And this saying was declared by the Kazakhs.<>

We must bring up the younger generation so that the minds and hearts of every citizen will have this simple and succinct thought from childhood on: «Kazakhstan is my homeland, and I bear responsibility for it the same way it is responsible for me».<>

The Kazakh steppe is the homeland of the Great Turkic peoples.<>

My cherished people, I shall sacrifice myself on your altar…In your name I am ready to use all my strength and the energy of my thoughts!<>

The people of Kazakhstan are the basis of our government. The land, the country – it all belongs to the Kazakhs. And this also makes them responsible for making it a prosperous nation.<>

Only a spiritually free people will have the power to do great deeds.<>

We are not a nation with a questionable past and an uncertain future.<>

The national spirit of the Kazakhs is shown in their heroism.<>

The society that truly knows its past can clearly foresee its future.<>

People who honour their ancestors strictly will flawlessly take care of their children’s future.<>

Without stable and reliable support from the people any leader is doomed to failure.<>

Only the person who since-rely loves his nation will be able to worry about its fate.<>

There is no greater honor than to justify the hopes and expectations of your people.<>

The golden key to friendship and understanding between the peoples is made from qualities inherent in Kazakh culture.<>

Without becoming a son of the nation, is it possible to become a son of mankind? It is unlikely, isn’t it?<>

It is impossible to truly respect other nations and national cultures without having one’s own national morale.<>

Freedom and democracy are the greatest good.<>

Civil peace and international harmony are our greatest assets.<>

The foundation of Kazakhstan’s patriotism is the equality of all citizens and their common responsibility for the honor of their Motherland.<>
